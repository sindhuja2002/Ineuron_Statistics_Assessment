#question 1
"""A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its
applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT
scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation
coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation
coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?"""

print(""" A correlation value of 0.7 between SAT scores and college GPA suggests that 
      the two variables have a 'strong positive association'.

The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, 
where -1 represents a 'perfect negative correlation' (as one variable increases, the other declines) 
and +1 represents a 'perfect positive correlation'  (as one variable increases, the other likewise increases).


A correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates that as SAT scores rise, so do college GPAs. 
This suggests that students who perform well on the SAT have higher college GPAs, and vice versa. 


However, it is not the only case as there are many factors for the rule of success and 
this inference is completely based on the 'given numeric values' and 'correlation coefficient concept'.""")
