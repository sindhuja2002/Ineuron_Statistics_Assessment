# Define the equations
equation1 = "2Y = 5 - X"
equation2 = "2X = 8 - 3Y"

# Extract the coefficients from equation12Y = 5 - X

eq1_constant = 5
eq1_coeff_x = -1
eq1_coeff_y = 2

# Extract the coefficients from equation2
eq2_constant = 8
eq2_coeff_x = 2
eq2_coeff_y = -3

# Rearrange equation1 to isolate Y
equation1_rearranged = f"Y = {eq1_coeff_x/eq1_coeff_y}X + {eq1_constant/eq1_coeff_y}"

# Calculate b_yx (byx)
byx = eq1_coeff_x / eq1_coeff_y
